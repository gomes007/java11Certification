Annotations in Java can have different retention policies, which determine at what point the annotation is discarded. The retention policy can be one of three types:

SOURCE: Annotations are discarded by the compiler during compilation.
CLASS: Annotations are recorded in the class file by the compiler but not retained at runtime.
RUNTIME: Annotations are recorded in the class file by the compiler and retained at runtime by the JVM.
Let's look at the given annotations:

A. @Deprecated
This annotation is retained at runtime (RUNTIME retention).
It's used to mark elements that should not be used and is available to the JVM and other tools at runtime.

B. @Override
This annotation has a SOURCE retention policy.
It is used to indicate that a method overrides a method declared in a superclass, and it is discarded by the compiler after it checks that the method does indeed override another method.

C. @SuppressWarnings
Like @Override, this annotation also has a SOURCE retention policy.
It's used to suppress compiler warnings about certain kinds of programming issues, and it is not needed after compile time.

D. @SafeVarargs
This annotation has a RUNTIME retention policy.
It's used to suppress warnings about potential unsafe operations involving varargs (variable-length arguments),
and it can be accessed at runtime.

E. @FunctionalInterface
This annotation also has a SOURCE retention policy.
It is used to indicate that an interface is intended to be a functional interface,
but this information is not needed at runtime.
